I perform research to understand, predict, measure, and control the motion of charged particle beams in particle accelerators. I focus on collective effects — those arising from the electromagnetic fields generated by the beam. I am also interested in beam diagnostics. The following are a few projections I am working on.
 

## High-dimensional phase space measurements

The space charge forces^[Space charge forces result from the electric field generated by the beam.] in an intense charged particle beam drive *halo formation* — the emergence of a sparsely populated region of position-momentum space (phase space) far from a dense core. Although the low-density halo has little influence on the core and is invisible in typical measurements, it places a fundamental limit on the beam intensity in high-power linear accelerators (linacs).

This limitation is due to *beam loss*, which occurs when particles wander outside the machine aperture — a common occurrence for halo particles. To avoid excessive radioactivation, the lost beam power must remain below one watt per meter along the beamline. For a one-megawatt beam, this corresponds to a fractional loss of $10^{-6}$. Current machines operate near this limit, and losses will scale linearly (or worse) with the beam intensity; to feasibly produce ten- or hundred-megawatt beams, halo formation must be controlled.
 
Unfortunately, no simulation has reproduced a measured phase space distribution at the halo level (four to six orders of magnitude below the peak core density). Although the physics is assumed to be modeled correctly, there remain significant uncertainties in the simulation inputs — the electromagnetic fields throughout the accelerator, and the initial phase space coordinates $\{x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z\}$ of each particle.
 
We are using the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) to address these uncertainties. The BTF is a one-to-one replica of the front end of the powerful SNS linac. It is equipped to measure the initial distribution of particles in six-dimensional phase space. Additionally, two-dimensional projections of the phase space can be measured with six orders of dynamic range, letting us see down to the halo level.^[The dynamic range is the maximum density that can be measured divided by the minimum density that can be measured.] Our goal is to perform a six-dimensional measurement at the start of the BTF, generate a simulation bunch from the measurement, propagate the bunch through the BTF in simulation, and benchmark the simulation against high-dynamic-range measurements at the end of the BTF. If the simulation and measurement agree, it would be an important step toward halo-level control in high-power hadron beams.
 
We are also using these measurements to identify and explain the origin of features in six-dimensional phase space — features that are invisible in low-dimensional measurements. For example, we have observed a hollow $p_z$ distribution at the center of the $x$-$p_x$-$y$-$p_y$ plane; we know this is driven by space charge but do not yet know its impact on the long-term beam dynamics.
 
  
## Phase space painting 
 
 
The intensity of a charged particle beam can be increased by a factor of one thousand or more by repeatedly injecting pulses from a linac into a circular accelerator (ring). Although space charge is not as strong in the ring due to the higher beam energy,[^1] its effects accumulate over multiple turns. [...]
