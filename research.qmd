I perform research to understand, predict, measure, and control the motion of charged particle beams in particle accelerators. I focus on collective effects — effects arising from the electromagnetic fields generated by the beam. I am also interested in beam diagnostics. This page describes a few projects I am working on.
 

## High-dimensional phase space measurements

The evolution of an intense charged particle beam is influenced by its electric field (space charge). For example, space charge can drive *halo formation* in the beam — the emergence of a sparsely populated region of position-momentum space (phase space) far from a dense core. Although the low-density halo has little influence on the core and is invisible in typical measurements, it places a fundamental limit on the beam intensity in high-power linear accelerators (linacs).

This limitation on the beam intensity is due to *beam loss*, which occurs when particles wander outside the machine aperture — a common occurrence for halo particles. To avoid excessive radioactivation, the lost beam power must remain below one watt per meter along the beamline. For a one-megawatt beam, this corresponds to a fractional loss of $10^{-6}$. Current machines operate near this limit, and losses will scale linearly (or worse) with the beam intensity; to feasibly produce ten- or hundred-megawatt beams, halo formation must be controlled.
 
But no simulation has reproduced a measured phase space distribution at the halo level (four to six orders of magnitude below the peak density). Although the physics is assumed to be modeled correctly, there remain significant uncertainties in the simulation inputs — the electromagnetic fields throughout the accelerator, and the initial phase space coordinates $\{x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z\}$ of each particle.
 
We are using the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS) to address these uncertainties. The BTF is a one-to-one replica of the front end of the powerful SNS linac. It is equipped to measure the initial distribution of particles in six-dimensional phase space. Additionally, two-dimensional phase space projections can be measured down to the halo level. Our goal is to measure the six-dimensional distribution at the start of the BTF, sample points from the measurement, track the points through the BTF in a simulation, and benchmark the result against high-dynamic-range measurements at the end of the BTF. If the simulation and measurement agree, it would be an important step toward halo-level control in high-power hadron beams.
 
We are also using these measurements to identify and explain the origin of features in six-dimensional phase space — features that are invisible in low-dimensional measurements. For example, we have observed a hollow $p_z$ distribution at the center of the $x$-$p_x$-$y$-$p_y$ plane; we know this is driven by space charge but do not yet know its impact on the long-term beam dynamics.
 
  
## Phase space painting 
 
 
The intensity of a charged particle beam can be increased by a factor of one thousand or more by repeatedly injecting pulses from a linac into a circular accelerator (ring). Although space charge is not as strong in the ring due to the higher beam energy,[^1] its effects accumulate over multiple turns. [...]

[^1]: The force between two charges moving at speed $v$ perpendicular to the line between the charges approaches zero as $v$ approaches the speed of light. See [http://kirkmcd.princeton.edu/examples/comoving.pdf]( http://kirkmcd.princeton.edu/examples/comoving.pdf).
