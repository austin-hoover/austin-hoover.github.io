The following is a short description of my current research interests. [Work in progress.]


## Collective effects in particle accelerators


*Accelerator physics* aims to understand, predict, measure, and control the behavior of charged particle beams in particle accelerators. This effort can be divided into three main categories: increasing the beam energy, increasing the beam intensity, and increasing the beam brightness (the density in position-momentum space (phase space)). 

The beam intensity in an accelerator is limited by *beam loss*: some particles are absorbed by the accelerator before they reach the target. These particles cause damage and radioactivation; the accelerator cannot operate safely if losses are too high. The standard operational requirement is to keep losses below one watt per meter along the beamline. This becomes more difficult to achieve as the beam power increases. Recently, after decades of research, several facilities have produced megawatts of beam power, but an improved understanding and control of beam loss mechanisms will be necessary to reach tens or hundreds of megawatts.

*Collective effects* — effects arising from the interactions between the ($10^{9}$-$10^{15}$) particles in the beam — are an important source of beam loss. Particles can interact indirectly (through wakefields left on the conducting vacuum chamber) or via direct Coulomb forces (also called *space charge forces*). (I focus primarily on space charge.) In either case, the resulting nonlinear dynamics are difficult to predict.


## Predicting halo formation in linacs

The space charge forces in an intense beam propagating in time-dependent external fields can drive unstable coherent oscillation modes. These modes can generally be avoided by carefully designing the fields. It is more difficult to avoid *halo formation*, the emergence of a low-density region of phase space far from a dense core. The losses resulting from halo formation will be unacceptable in multi-megawatt facilities.

All attempts to predict halo-level dynamics have been unsuccessful. Although the physics is assumed to be modelled correctly, there remain significant uncertainties in the simulation inputs — [...]
