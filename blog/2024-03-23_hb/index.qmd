I gave a talk at the "68th Advanced Beam Dynamics Workshop on High-Brightness and High-Intensity Hadron Beams" (HB) a few months ago at CERN. There were around 200 attendees from the USA, Korea, China, UK, Germany, Italy, France, and Switzerland.  It was a packed [schedule](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1138716/timetable/#20231009.detailed), with talks running from 9 AM to 7 PM. 

This workshop splits into five sections: 

1. Beam dyanmics in rings
2. Beam dynamics in linacs

accelerator systems, operations and comissioning, and beam diagnostics. There are many interesting problems in ring dyanmics, so that was the biggest section.
