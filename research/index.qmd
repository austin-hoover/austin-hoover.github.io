Accelerator and beam physics is "the science of the motion, generation, acceleration, manipulation, prediction, observation and use of charged particle beams" @Nagaitsev_2022. My research focuses on the intense beams produced in high-power hadron accelerators. High-power accelerators can generate secondary beams of [neutrons](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns), [neutrinos](https://www.dunescience.org), and [muons](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/particle-physicists-dream-of-a-muon-collider/). In the future, hadron accelerators could produce [nuclear energy](https://myrrha.be). Several machines now operate above 1 MW beam power (similar to the 1 TeV milestone in high-energy colliders), with future machines moving toward 10 MW.

Particle-particle interactions become significant at high intensities. Particles interact directly via Coloumb forces---also called *space charge* forces---and indirectly via electromagnetic wakefields. The resulting particle trajectories can be complicated and difficult predict. Unpredicted particle *losses*, which occur when particles wander outside the accelerator aperture, are especially important. Lost particles generate radiation when they interact with the environment. The lost beam power must remain below one watt per meter (1 W/m)---around one out of every million particles---to keep radiation levels safe. Modern accelerators operate near this limit; naively scaling the intensity by a factor of 10 would violate the loss limit. Thus, 10 MW accelerators are currently *out of reach*.

A complete understanding of beam loss will require detailed computational models. Such models exist but are difficult to validate due to uncertainties in the beam and accelerator state. Thus, a major research focus is to measure the particle distribution in the accelerator, characterize the uncertainties in the model parameters, and validate computational models against direct measurements. A separate but related problem is *controlling* the beam in the accelerator. For example, can we guard against instabilities by shaping the particle distribution? Can we minimize particle losses by tweaking the force fields we apply to the beam?

Below are a few projects I've worked on to address these questions.


## Halo formation in linear accelerators

Linear accelerators generate tight bunches of particles in a single pass. The combined effects of applied and self-generated fields drive some particles to large amplitudes, creating a low-density "halo" surrounding a dense core. Halo is almost invisible and barely influences the core, but it places hard constraints on the beam power since it leads to beam loss. Halo formation is challenging to predict because of its sensitivity to model parameters. In particular, we do not know the initial particle distribution in the full six-dimensional (6D) position-momentum space, also called *phase space*. It is also challenging to measure such a faint signal on top of the bright core.

We're using the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS) to address this problem on a small scale. The BTF is a replica of the first few meters of the 400-meter SNS linac. It is equipped to measure the initial 6D distribution and the output 2D halo distribution. We are leveraging these unique diagnostics to benchmark PIC simulations at a new level of detail and better understand halo formation processes.

## Novel beam injection techniques

Our primary method to generate intense beams is to repeatedly inject small pulses from a linear accelerator (linac) into a circular accelerator (ring). Space charge forces drive resonances and collective instabilities in the circulating beam, leading to particle loss. One approach to mitigate space charge effects is to vary the position and momentum of the injected beam relative to the circulating beam during accumulation; this is known as *phase space painting*. We're exploring different painting methods to shape the four-dimensional phase space density of the accumulated beam during injection.

## Proton bunch compression

A muon collider (MC) is a promising option to study the Standard Model at the 10 TeV energy range. In current MC designs, the initial muon bunch would be generated by colliding an intense proton beam with a metal target (generating pions which eventually decay into muons). The proton bunch can only be a few nanoseconds long, requiring a special compressor ring. This extreme proton bunch compression will amplify collective effects such as space charge, impedances, and electron-cloud instabilities. We'd like to study these effects experimentally by compressing an intense proton beam in the SNS.

## Phase space tomography

Classical particles are described by their position and momentum in three-dimensional space. Together, these form a six-dimensional *phase space*. Direct phase space measurements are not always possible; sometimes we have only partial information, such as the particle density along a single dimension. Still, partial information constrains the unknown phase space distribution, and one may attempt to find a distribution consistent with these constraints. I'm interested in applying entropic and Bayesian methods to this problem to incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty.
