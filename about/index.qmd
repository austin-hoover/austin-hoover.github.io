I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee (2022) and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (2018).

I primarily study intense charged particle beam dynamics and phase space reconstruction techniques. See [Research](../research/index.qmd) and [Papers](../papers/index.qmd) for more info.

I hope to use this blog to share my work and learn about topics outside my research area. Outside of physics, I'm especially interested in the philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of religion.
