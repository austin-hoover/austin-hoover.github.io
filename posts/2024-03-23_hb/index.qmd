I gave a talk at the Workshop on High-Brightness and High-Intensity Hadron Beams (HB) a few months ago at CERN. The workshop happens every two years and is now closer to a conference. There were around 200 attendees from the USA, Korea, China, UK, Germany, Italy, France, and Switzerland. It was a packed [schedule](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1138716/timetable/#20231009.detailed), with talks running from 9 AM to 7 PM. 


## Hello there this is a section

*Beam dynamics in rings* **Beam dynamics in rings** alksjflksjdfa

1. Beam dyanmics in rings*: circular accelerators
2. beam dynamics in linacs
3. accelerator systems

accelerator systems, operations and comissioning, and beam diagnostics. There are many interesting problems in ring dyanmics, so that was the biggest section.
