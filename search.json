Halo particles produce radiation during unintended collisions before reaching their target. The lost beam power must remain below one watt per meter to keep radiation levels safe; this fractional loss corresponds to one out of every million particles in a one-megawatt beam.

In particular, we typically do not know the initial particle distribution in six-dimensional (6D) position-momentum space (phase space). We’re using the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) to address this problem on a small scale.

    "text": "Phase space tomography\nDirect 6D phase space distributions take a long time (24 hours) and are only possible at low energies. In other cases, we can only measure projections of the distribution onto position space. For example, we can record the 1D density by scanning a wire across the beam. Performing such measurements at different locations constrains the beam’s phase space distribution. However, it is often the case that more than one distribution is consistent with data. The same inverse problem is encountered in computed tomography (CT). Phase space tomography can be more challenging because the distribution has four or six dimensions while the measurements have one our two. I’m studying methods to improve high-dimensional phase space tomography, particularly maximum-entropy methods.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Entropy maximization (MENT) is a conservative approach to inverse problems."

    "section": "Painting and beam dynamics in rings",
    "text": "Painting and beam dynamics in rings\nOur primary method to generate intense beams is to repeatedly inject pulses from a linear accelerator (linac) into a circular accelerator (ring). Nonlinear space charge forces drive resonances and collective instabilities in the circulating beam, leading to particle loss. Understanding these effects is an active research area. One approach to mitigate space charge effects is to vary the position and momentum of the injected beam relative to the circulating beam during accumulation. We call this phase space painting. We’re studying a new painting method to generate a vortex beam, where particles swirl inside an elliptical boundary. Such a beam would minimize the nonlinear component of space charge forces, potentially leading to higher intensities. At the same time, the beam would occupy a tiny volume of phase space, making it useful for high-energy colliders.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3. A four-dimensional phase space reconstruction from an SNS painting experiment. Cross-plane correlations indicate the beam is partially spinning."
