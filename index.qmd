I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). My research focuses on collective effects in high-power hadron accelerators. (See [Research](./research/index.qmd) and [Publications](./publications/index.qmd).) I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).

Previously, I completed a PhD in physics at the University of Tennessee and a BS in physics at Wheaton College (IL).
