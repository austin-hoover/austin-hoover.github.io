I'm a Staff Scientist at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov), working in the Accelerator Physics Group. Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (IL).

I'm interested in techniques to model, measure, and control intense beams in particle accelerators. I currently focus on (i) collective effects such as halo formation, (ii) phase space shaping, and (iii) inverse problems such as phase space tomography. [Here](./research/index.qmd) is a more detailed overview of my research. I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).
