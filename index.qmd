I am a postdoc in the Accelerator Physics Group at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS). I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee (2022) and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (2018).

My research is in the field of accelerator physics, where the goal is to understand, predict, measure, and control the behavior of charged particle beams. In particular, I focus on increasing the intensity of hadron beams in linear and circular accelerators. Intense hadron beams have a variety of applications, ranging from nuclear/particle physics and nuclear energy production. [...]
