:::{#my-heading}

I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). I primarily study intense charged particle beam dynamics and phase space reconstruction techniques (see [Research](./research/index.qmd) and [Papers](./papers/index.qmd)). I also write about my work on my [Blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).
