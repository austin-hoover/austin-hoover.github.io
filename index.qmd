I am a postdoc in the Accelerator Physics Group at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS). Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (2022) and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (2018).

My research is in the field of accelerator physics, where the goal is to understand, predict, measure, and control the behavior of charged particle beams. In particular, I focus on increasing the intensity of hadron beams in linear and circular accelerators.

This site contains a summary of my current research projects, a list of publications and presentations, and my blog, where I write mostly about physics and philosophy.
