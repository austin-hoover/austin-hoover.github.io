I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the [University of Tennessee](https://physics.utk.edu) and a B.S. in physics at [Wheaton College]().


## Research

I'm interested in techniques to model, measure, and control intense charged particle beams in particle accelerators. I currently focus on (i) theory and modeling of collective effects, such as halo formation and instabilities, (ii) phase space shaping and manipulation, and (iii) inverse problems such as phase space tomography. I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).

Particle accelerators are [essential tools](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/themes/accelerators-and-nobel-laureates/) for scientific research. For example, hadron accelerators generate [neutrons](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns), [neutrinos](https://www.dunescience.org), and [muons](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/particle-physicists-dream-of-a-muon-collider/) for experiments in condensed matter physics, material science, nuclear physics, and particle physics; and in the future, hadron accelerators may drive [nuclear fission reactors](https://www.sckcen.be/en/infrastructure/myrrha). Many of these applications require hadron beams of enormous density at high repetition rates and with tailored distributions in phase space. Satisfying these constraints at high intensities is a major challenge because of collective effects such as space charge, wake fields, and electron cloud formation, all of which drive multiparticle resonances and instabilities in the beam.
