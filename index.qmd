I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). I'm interested in techniques to model, measure, and control intense beams in particle accelerators. I currently focus on (i) the theory and modeling of collective effects, such as halo formation and instabilities, (ii) phase space shaping and manipulation techniques, (iii) the application of probability theory and machine learning to inverse problems such as phase space tomography. I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the [University of Tennessee](https://physics.utk.edu) and a B.S. in physics at [Wheaton College]().
