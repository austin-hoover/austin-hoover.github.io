I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (IL).

I'm interested in developing theoretical, computational, and experimental techniques to model, measure, and control intense beams in particle accelerators. Currently, I focus on halo formation in high-power linear accelerators (linacs) and beam shaping in circular accelerators (rings). I'm also interested in applying tools from probability theory and machine learning to inverse problems such as phase space tomography.


I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).
