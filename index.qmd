:::{#my-heading}

I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). I primarily study intense charged particle beam dynamics and phase space reconstruction techniques (see [research](./research/index.qmd) and [publications](./publications/index.qmd)). I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).
