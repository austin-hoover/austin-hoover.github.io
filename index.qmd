I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). I'm interested in techniques to model, measure, and control intense beams in particle accelerators. I currently focus on halo formation in high-power linear accelerators and beam shaping in circular accelerators. I'm also interested in applying ideas from probability theory and machine learning to inverse problems such as phase space tomography. I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the [University of Tennessee](https://physics.utk.edu) and a B.S. in physics at [Wheaton College]().
