I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). My reseach focuses on the dynamics of intense charged particle beams in high-power accelerators.

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Tennessee (2022) and a B.S. in physics at Wheaton College (2018).
