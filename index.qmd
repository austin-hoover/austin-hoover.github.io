I'm a physicist in the Accelerator Physics Group at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in physics at the [University of Tennessee](https://physics.utk.edu) and a B.S. in physics at [Wheaton College]().


## Research

I'm interested in techniques to model, measure, and control intense charged particle beams in particle accelerators. I currently focus on (i) theory and modeling of collective effects, such as halo formation and instabilities, (ii) phase space shaping and manipulation, and (iii) inverse problems such as phase space tomography. I sometimes write about my work on my [blog](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/).

[Here](./research/index.qmd) is a more detailed overview of my research.
